DragonRuby GTK Log Messages. Set $gtk.log_level = :off to disable logging to the Console/HUD (log messages will still be written here). Log options are: :on, :off.
* INFO: Marked app/main.rb for reload. (-1)
* INFO: Game state and exception will be written to exceptions/game_state_0.txt and exceptions/current.txt.

* WARNING: GameObj does not support serialization. Returning nil.
Please override the :serialize method and return a hash so that
Class can be persisted to disk in the event of an exception.
Here is an example of what you need to do:
#+begin_src ruby
class GameObj
  # 1. Create a serialize method that returns a hash with all of
  #    the values you care about.
  def serialize
    { main_player: main_player }
  end

  # 2. Override the inspect method and return ~serialize.to_s~.
  def inspect
    serialize.to_s
  end

  # 3. Override to_s and return ~serialize.to_s~.
  def to_s
    serialize.to_s
  end
end
#+end_src
